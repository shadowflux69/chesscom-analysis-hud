# Chess.com Analysis HUD

A Chrome extension that adds a mini HUD overlay on chess.com analysis pages.  
It detects the current board state, displays it as a mini-board, shows the FEN string, and can connect to a local Stockfish WASM engine for move suggestions in **analysis/review only** (never in live games).

## ‚ú® Features
- Mini-board HUD that updates automatically with the current position  
- FEN export for use in other tools  
- Optional integration with Stockfish WASM for local best-move suggestions  
- Configurable engine path via extension options  

---

## üöß Known Issues
- The Stockfish engine may not start if the JS/WASM files are missing or misconfigured  
- Some black pieces may occasionally appear as white  
- The board can sometimes be flipped compared to the chess.com orientation  
- I am new to coding and still learning, so I don‚Äôt yet know how to fix these issues
